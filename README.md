# ChainFlow: Decentralized Limit Order Execution via Cross-Chain Atomic Swaps

ChainFlow provides a secure and private platform for executing limit orders across different blockchain networks using atomic swaps and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs). It eliminates the need for centralized exchanges or trusted intermediaries, offering a trustless and censorship-resistant trading environment. By leveraging atomic swaps, ChainFlow ensures that trades are either fully executed or completely reverted, preventing partial fills and guaranteeing counterparty risk mitigation. zk-SNARKs further enhance privacy by allowing users to prove the validity of their trades without revealing sensitive information such as the order size or price.

The core functionality of ChainFlow revolves around creating and fulfilling limit orders across different blockchain networks. Users can specify the desired price and quantity for a particular asset pair, and the system automatically searches for matching orders on other chains. Upon finding a match, an atomic swap is initiated, ensuring that both parties receive the agreed-upon assets simultaneously. The use of zk-SNARKs allows users to prove the validity of their orders and the execution of the atomic swap without revealing specific details to the public blockchain. This protects user privacy and prevents front-running attacks. ChainFlow aims to create a more efficient and transparent decentralized trading ecosystem.

ChainFlow's architecture is designed for modularity and scalability. It comprises several key components, including order book management, cross-chain communication, atomic swap coordination, and zk-SNARK proof generation and verification. Each component is designed to be independent and easily replaceable, allowing for future upgrades and integration with new blockchain networks and technologies. The platform is written in Python and leverages existing libraries for cryptography, blockchain communication, and zero-knowledge proof generation. ChainFlow is designed to be easily deployed and integrated into existing decentralized applications (dApps) and trading platforms.

## Key Features

*   **Cross-Chain Atomic Swaps:** Facilitates the exchange of assets across different blockchain networks without the need for trusted intermediaries. Uses Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) to ensure atomic execution, meaning either both parties receive their assets or the trade is completely reverted. Example: A user can trade Bitcoin (BTC) for Ethereum (ETH) directly without relying on a central exchange.
*   **Decentralized Limit Orders:** Allows users to set limit orders on a decentralized order book, enabling precise control over trade execution. Order matching is performed algorithmically based on price and quantity.
*   **zk-SNARKs for Privacy:** Implements zero-knowledge proofs to protect user privacy by obscuring sensitive trade details. Uses the libsnark library to generate and verify proofs that demonstrate the validity of trades without revealing order parameters.
*   **Verifiable Trade Settlement:** Ensures that all trades are settled correctly and transparently, with cryptographic proofs of execution publicly available. The on-chain proofs guarantee the integrity of the trading process.
*   **Order Book Management:** The system maintains a decentralized order book, enabling efficient matching of buy and sell orders. The order book is stored using a distributed database system (e.g., IPFS) for censorship resistance.
*   **Gas Optimization:** Implements strategies to minimize gas costs associated with cross-chain transactions and zk-SNARK verification. For example, batch verification techniques are used to reduce the overall gas footprint.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The system is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy integration of new blockchain networks and features. This facilitates future scalability and adaptability.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for developing the ChainFlow platform. It offers a rich ecosystem of libraries for cryptography, networking, and data processing.
*   **Solidity:** Used for writing smart contracts deployed on blockchains such as Ethereum. Smart contracts manage the atomic swap process and verify zk-SNARK proofs.
*   **Web3.py:** A Python library for interacting with Ethereum-based blockchains. It is used to deploy and interact with smart contracts.
*   **libsnark:** A C++ library for generating and verifying zk-SNARKs. It's used to create proofs for private and verifiable trade settlements. Python bindings or external processes are used to interface with libsnark.
*   **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** Used for storing the decentralized order book and other persistent data in a censorship-resistant manner.
*   **Redis:** In-memory data structure store used for caching and real-time data processing, enabling faster order matching and transaction processing.

## Installation

1.  Clone the ChainFlow repository:

    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/ChainFlow.git
    cd ChainFlow

2.  Install the required Python packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3.  Install libsnark (refer to libsnark's documentation for detailed instructions). Note: this may require compiling from source. Ensure the correct dependencies for your operating system are installed.

4.  Install and configure Redis. Ensure Redis is running on the default port (6379) or configure the connection settings accordingly.

5.  Install IPFS. Start the IPFS daemon after installation.

## Configuration

1.  Set environment variables:

    *   `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL`: The URL of your Ethereum node (e.g., Infura, Alchemy).
    *   `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your Ethereum private key.
    *   `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the deployed smart contract.
    *   `IPFS_HOST`: The IPFS host address (default: localhost).
    *   `IPFS_PORT`: The IPFS port number (default: 5001).
    *   `REDIS_HOST`: The Redis host address (default: localhost).
    *   `REDIS_PORT`: The Redis port number (default: 6379).

    You can set these variables in your `.env` file or directly in your shell.

2.  Configure the smart contract:

    *   Deploy the Solidity smart contract to your desired blockchain network.
    *   Update the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable with the address of the deployed contract.

## Usage

1.  Run the ChainFlow platform:

    python main.py

2.  API Documentation (Example):

    ChainFlow exposes a simple API for creating and managing limit orders:

    *   `create_limit_order(asset_pair, price, quantity, side)`: Creates a new limit order. `asset_pair` is the trading pair (e.g., "BTC/ETH"), `price` is the desired price, `quantity` is the amount, and `side` is either "buy" or "sell".
    *   `cancel_limit_order(order_id)`: Cancels an existing limit order.
    *   `get_order_book(asset_pair)`: Retrieves the order book for a specific asset pair.

    Example usage:

    from chainflow import ChainFlow

    cf = ChainFlow()
    order_id = cf.create_limit_order("BTC/ETH", 0.05, 1, "buy")
    order_book = cf.get_order_book("BTC/ETH")

    Note: Detailed API documentation including specific input and output formats is available in the `docs/` directory.
